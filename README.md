1.    (Employee Class) Create a class called Employee that includes three instance variables—a first name (type String ), a last name (type String ) and a monthly salary ( double ). Provide a constructor that initializes the three instance variables. Provide a set and a get method for each instance variable. If the monthly salary is not positive, do not set its value. Write a test app named EmployeeTest that demonstrates class Employee ’s capabilities. Create two Employee objects and display each object’s yearly salary. Then give each Employee a 10% raise and display each Employee ’s yearly salary again.



2.    (Date Class) Create a class called Date that includes three instance variables—a month (type int), a day (type int ) and a year (type int ). Provide a constructor that initializes the three instance variables and assumes that the values provided are correct. Provide a set and a get method for each instance variable. Provide a method displayDate that displays the month, day and year separated by forward slashes ( / ). Write a test app named DateTest that demonstrates class Date ’s capabilities.
